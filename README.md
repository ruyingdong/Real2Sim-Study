# Paper Abstract

This paper presents a rigorous evaluation of Real-to-Sim parameter estimation approaches for fabric manipulation in robotics. The study systematically assesses three state-of-the-art approaches, namely two differential pipelines and a data-driven approach. We also devise a novel physics-informed neural network approach for physics parameter estimation. These approaches are interfaced with two simulations across multiple Real-to-Sim scenarios (lifting, wind blowing, and stretching) for five different fabric types and evaluated on three unseen scenarios (folding, fling, and shaking).
